###### NOTES ########

# redo the calculations for knowledge indicator for impact paper (end of October)
      #work with David on getting the new harmonised master file
      #reorganise the workflow


# work on figure for trend paper 
      # reverse y axes to match conceptual figure
      # run other options we discussed on how to caculate sampling effort
          # Richard - five previous years idea
          # Hezi - use a grid to disconsider "duplicates"
          # Quentin - using number of unique observers per day as sampling effort
              #also use some kind of grid
      # do a GAM to smooth the curve and show the uncertainty
      # Australia (goes down in the end), or Belgium (both lines going up)
      # Chile or France show intros going down, survey up, ideal scenario
      # China, both going down
      # New Caledonia, good example of data bias
